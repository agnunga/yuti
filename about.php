            ULU is a small scale micro financing company. You DO NOT PAY anything to be part of ULU. Nothing at all. Not a dime.
            We do not charge a membership fee not unless you belong in the Elite Membership Club.
            ULU lends you money and you repay it back with interest. That's how ULU sustains itself.
            Not on membership fees, but on interests ... and our rates are competitive.<br>
            <hr />
            ULU's goal is to be viable within the next five years. To be a place where all Kenyans,
            regardless of their familial or economic background, can feel free to come and seek a
            "mkopo rahisi" with nothing else to show but an ID. All we want to do is build trust with our customers.
            The same way my mom used to go to my neighbor's kiosk and borrow a gallon of milk and other whatnots.
            The shopkeeper never questioned who she was or whether he'll be repaid. He just knew. That's ULU's mission.
            But we will have to bridge this unfamiliarity gap in simple steps. Allow us to know you and then go on from there.<br>
            <hr>

            Once you submit your documents, and sign the required forms, and we ascertain that you understand the terms
            and conditions of your loan, the money will be deposited into your m'pesa or Equitel account within 24hrs.
